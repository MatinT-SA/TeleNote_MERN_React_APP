# TeleNote_MERN_React_APP
This is a social media app called "TeleNote" powered by MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js Node.js) which allows users to sign up and create their own account and then do CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on this web application and share their life activities and cool moments with people all around the world.
They can also like other people's posts, comment below them in each post's individual page. Also the Search and Pagination features have been implemented in it.
[New features will be added to this project or some of its issues will be fixed in the future]
